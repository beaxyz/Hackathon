1,Bearings of the pump indicate wear and tear that show signs of damage,"Simon harris will first try to lubricate and align the bearing to see if it would resolve the issue. If that does not work, he will replace the bearings next Friday (23/10/24)"
2,Pump seal does not seem to be working upon inspection,Check seal installation and ensure that it's compatible to the pumped fluid. The seal chamber pressure and temperature also needs to be checked
3,"Pump showed signs of wear and tear, there seems to be corrosion and erosion after 15 years, which is causing weakening of the pump body as well as contamination to the fluids flowing through as debris was found",James had applied special coating but would need to replace the pump with materials resistant to corrosion such as stainless steel if it does not resolve the issue 
4,Leakage seems to appear around pump seals,Paul Connie inspected and reinstalled the seal. If it continues the seal would need to be replaced
5,Corrosion around the pump impellers which is causing reduced performance seen with low pressure lately,Arun will be checking the material and applying coating to see if it would help. Another follow up action is putting in a schedule for maintenance for week commencing 03/11/23
6,Pump is creating lots of noise and has reduced flow rate,Checked the pump and Jonny ordered a replacement pump as there seems to be mechanical damage to the pump. The part is expected to arrive next week on 04/06/23
7,"Pump has stopped completely, this is critical and require immediate resolution. This has been escalated to Jonny whos the engineer on duty and he will have an inspection first thing in the morning.",Tried restarting the pump but not working. New pump taken from store and installed on site within a few hours. Replacement ordered for the back up pump which will arrive in a few weeks
8,Pump hoses have come off,Inspected and reattached the hoses. Ran the pump for a few hours after and everything is working fine
9,New pump installed last week is leaking and cause loud noises. Pump pressure so far seems to be unaffected,Checked and there was a misalignment with the pump internal fixings. This has been fixed. A regular maintenance needs to be done to ensure that it doesn't go out of alignment
10,Bearings of the pump are worn out,Replaced bearings and ordered replacement for back up. Pump has been working fine since
